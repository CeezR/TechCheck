### Learning the Art of Simplicity: ðŸš€ A Lesson in Overcomplication

ðŸŒ± "Don't bite off more than you can chew. Sometimes, a simple solution is the best solution."

ðŸŽ¯ "Don't build what you think you need, build what you actually need!"

ðŸ¥´ "KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)."

#### ðŸ’¡ Situation:
Fresh off completing the core curriculum of the Salt Java Carrier Bootcamp, I was eager to create my very first full-stack application. The goal I set for myself was not merely to produce something tangible, a testament to the 10 grueling weeks of hard work, but also to create something practical and useful. As I was well aware of the challenges awaiting me in the upcoming interviews, this project was designed with a clear purpose in mind.

#### ðŸ”¥ Task:
The task was tied closely to the lessons learned around communication between the back-end and front-end. The application was designed to use an in-memory database to store two entities: Topic and Question, with Topic having a OneToMany relationship with Question. The front-end was responsible for fetching the available topics and displaying the related questions. Moreover, the question list needed to be responsive; as users selected different topics, the question list would automatically update.

#### ðŸ’­ Action:
To achieve this, I considered two potential solutions:

A single getMapping that returns a list of Topic objects, each containing a list of Question objects.
Two separate getMapping calls: one returning a list of Topic names, and the other fetching Question objects for a specific Topic, with the topic name passed as a RequestParam in the URL.
I opted for the second solution, motivated by the belief that one should only request the data they need, and admittedly, it also seemed more technically impressive.

#### ðŸ˜• Result:
In retrospect, the chosen approach led me down a path of complexity that required significantly more effort for a less optimal result. The back-end hosting costs, based on fetch calls, meant that the additional requests were economically unwise, especially given that most calls returned largely similar data.

My initial design was based on an assumption of the application scaling to tens of thousands of questions, whereas, in reality, only a hundred or so were added. While this miscalculation didn't break the application, the time and effort spent on designing the extra endpoint, mapping the entity data into a new object, handling the topic list from the query param, dealing with issues related to special characters in topic names, and managing the additional complexity on the front-end, was substantial and, in hindsight, unnecessary.

This experience served as a valuable lesson ðŸ’¡ in the importance of keeping things simple, understanding the actual needs of the project, and not overcomplicating the design unnecessarily.
